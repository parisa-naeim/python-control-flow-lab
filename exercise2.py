# Exercise 2: Old enough to vote?
#
# Write a Python function named `check_voting_eligibility` that determines if a user is old enough to vote.
# Fill in the logic to perform the eligibility check inside the function.
#
# Function Details:
# - Prompt the user to input their age: "Please enter your age: "
# - Validate the input to ensure the age is a possible value (no negative numbers).
# - Determine if the user is eligible to vote. Set a variable for the voting age.
# - Print a message indicating whether the user is eligible to vote based on the entered age.
#
# Hints:
# - Use the `input()` function to capture the user's age.
# - Use `int()` to convert the input to an integer. Ensure to handle any conversion errors gracefully.
# - Use a conditional statement to check if the age meets the minimum voting age requirement.

def check_voting_eligibility():
    votingAge = 18
    print("Please enter your age: ")
    age = input()
    
    try:
        votterAge = int(age)
        if votterAge < 0:
            print("It cannot be a negative number")
        elif votterAge < 18:
            print("You are not elligible to vote")
        else:
            print("You are elligible to vote")

    except:
      print("It should be a number")


    # Your control flow logic goes here

# Call the function
check_voting_eligibility()
